Meet master mechanic Fuzz Townshend and radio and TV presenter Tim Shaw, a petrol-head pair who undertake dramatic automobile interventions across the UK, hoping to return some much-loved motors to their former glory. With a tight deadline to turn each job around without the owners knowing, find out how these neglected classics fell in need of a little loving care â€“ and what Fuzz and Tim can do to get them back on the road.</p>",
